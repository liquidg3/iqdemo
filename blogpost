<p>Businesses of the 21st century increasingly find themselves in a post-cash world.&nbsp; The use of credit cards since
    2000 has grown by $10 billion of transactions, while the use of debit cards has grown almost tenfold to $50 billion,&nbsp;<a
            href="http://www.frbsf.org/cash/publications/fed-notes/2014/april/cash-consumer-spending-payment-diary">according</a>&nbsp;to
    the Federal Reserve.&nbsp; The increased use of debit and credit cards poses a series of challenges for any business
    due to the risks of processing a credit card payment online.&nbsp; A cash-based business has nothing to fear
    regarding identity theft or hacking, while a business relying on credit card processing for most or all of their
    transactions opens itself up to security threats.&nbsp; What are the biggest risks of online credit card payments?
</p>
<h2><b>Identity Theft</b></h2>
<p>One of the greatest issues with any type of online purchase lies in the connection security.&nbsp; PC World Magazine&nbsp;<a
        href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2043095/heres-what-an-eavesdropper-sees-when-you-use-an-unsecured-wi-fi-hotspot.html">reminds</a>&nbsp;all
    web users that it's crucial to secure a wireless connection or else an outside user will be able to read and
    download credit card data.&nbsp; A file transfer protocol (FTP) will show up as plain text, making it crucial to use
    encryption software in order to keep anyone from reading credit card information.&nbsp; The cost of a data breach
    shouldn't be underestimated.&nbsp; In addition to the negative press for a company that's hit by identity theft,
    Symantec&nbsp;<a
            href="https://www4.symantec.com/mktginfo/whitepaper/053013_GL_NA_WP_Ponemon-2013-Cost-of-a-Data-Breach-Report_daiNA_cta72382.pdf">reports</a>&nbsp;that
    the average direct costs are $5 million on average.&nbsp; Your payment processor should&nbsp;<a
            href="https://www.vantiv.com/online-payments/fraud-protection">provide</a>&nbsp;online card data security
    protection that minimizes the risks from a data breach, leaving customers' information private and businesses'
    transactions secure.</p>
<h2><b>Compliance Costs</b></h2>
<p>Handling a credit card payment online requires compliance with legal guidelines.&nbsp; National and state compliance
    laws have created industry standards for all companies that store, process, or transmit credit card information.&nbsp;
    The biggest of those standards is PCI DSS.&nbsp; The cost of compliance can&nbsp;<a
            href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/blog/what-does-it-cost-to-become-pci-compliant/">vary</a>&nbsp;based
    on the size and scope of a business. Technology certifications have a range of costs depending on the size of the
    business, but all require quarterly scans that range from $150 to $2500 per IP address per year.&nbsp; The same
    report that outlines the costs also reports that a company storing 100,000 credit cards will pay a compliance cost
    of $6 per card, representing a major investment. Particularly for smaller online businesses, it's critical to
    understand what your payments provider offers to help you with understanding and complying with PCI standards.</p>
<h2><b>Transactions and Volume</b></h2>
<p>With more credit card payments come additional bottlenecks.&nbsp; The Chicago Tribune&nbsp;<a
        href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-chip-cards-1102-biz-20151030-story.html">reported</a>&nbsp;that
    chip-secured cards slowed down processing, leading to frustrated customers who may not even realize that their
    credit cards contain such chips.&nbsp; Roadblocks to a sale never make for online success; 25% of online sales&nbsp;<a
            href="http://www.sdcexec.com/article/12138167/how-to-fix-the-three-biggest-mistakes-e-commerce-sites-make">report</a>&nbsp;that
    they prefer to check out as a guest to avoid the complexities of log-ins; 50% of customers never return to a site
    once they leave to look for a discount code.</p>
